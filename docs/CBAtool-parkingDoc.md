## Project Overview
The CBAtool (Cable Burial Analysis Tool) is a Python application for analyzing cable burial depth data and position quality. It enables users to identify non-compliant sections, detect anomalies, and generate interactive visualizations and reports.
CBAtool has made substantial progress in its architectural foundation, but a comprehensive code review has identified several critical issues that need to be addressed before production deployment. The most urgent priorities are implementing a testing framework, harmonizing analyzer classes, restructuring the UI application, and refactoring the report generator for improved maintainability and reliability.

## Development Principles
- **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- **YAGNI** (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- **SOLID principles** (for maintainable and scalable code)
- **AIM for enteprise grade code**

## Current Development Status
- Significant progress has been made in report generation. The standardized `ReportGenerator` class is fully functional and capable of handling depth and position analysis, including PDF report generation. 
- UI improvements are ongoing to better the functionality and usability
- Significant improvements required to visualisations
- Basic reporting functionality is implemented but requires improvement.
- Major issues with useage of git repo. lack of experience means i was working on feature development branches and not merging back into the develop branch. currently trying to reslove lost functionality

  - Depth anomalies (physically impossible depths, sudden changes)
  - Position anomalies (KP jumps, reversals, duplicates)
  - DCC deviations (gradual and significant)
- Developed `reporting_test.py` for pipeline validation
- Verified proper generation of Excel and PDF reports

### Report Consolidation Enhancements
- Added robust input validation before processing
- Improved error handling to continue with valid reports
- Enhanced summary sheet with metadata and report statistics

### Temporal Comparison Implementation
- Created comparative metrics between datasets
- Implemented visualization for temporal changes
- Exportable comparison reports now available

## Future Architectural Improvements
1. **Factory Pattern for Analyzer Creation**
   - Dynamic selection of analyzer type based on data.
   - Estimated complexity: Medium  
2. **Observer Pattern for Analysis Events**
   - Event-driven notifications for UI updates.
   - Estimated complexity: Medium  
3. **Strategy Pattern for Algorithm Selection**
   - Supports dynamic selection of analysis algorithms.
   - Estimated complexity: High  

## Git Workflow Strategy
### Branching Strategy

- **Cricital misunderstanding of git functions and flow**: not merging functional features back into develop, I lost track of whats going on and have broken a lot

- **Feature Branches**: Development occurs on separate branches (e.g., `feature/standardized-reporting`).
- **Main Branch Stability**: Only tested and reviewed changes are merged.

### Commit Message Guidelines
Format:
```bash
[Component] Short description of change

- Detailed change summary
- Reference issue if applicable (e.g., #123)
```
Example:
```bash
[ReportGenerator] Fixed PDF export layout

- Adjusted margins for better readability
- Improved table formatting
- Resolves #45
```
# Git Workflow Guide

## Branch Structure
The CBATool project uses a three-tier branching strategy:

```
main (stable, production-ready code)
  ↑
develop (integration branch)
  ↑
feature branches (one per feature)
```

## Workflow Process

### 1. Starting Feature Development
Always start by creating a feature branch from the latest develop branch:

```bash
git checkout develop         # Start from develop branch
git pull                     # Make sure it's up to date
git checkout -b feature/xyz  # Create new feature branch
```

### 2. Making Regular Commits
Make small, focused commits with descriptive messages:

```bash
git add [changed files]
git commit -m "feat: descriptive message about changes"
```

### 3. Staying Updated with Develop
Regularly integrate changes from develop to avoid divergence:

```bash
git checkout develop
git pull
git checkout feature/xyz
git merge develop           # Merge develop into your feature branch
# Resolve any conflicts
```

### 4. Completing Feature Development
Before merging, ensure your feature is complete and tested:

```bash
# Run tests to make sure everything works
git push -u origin feature/xyz  # Push to remote repository
```

### 5. Merging Feature into Develop
Use the no-fast-forward flag to preserve feature branch history:

```bash
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff feature/xyz   # --no-ff preserves feature branch history
git push origin develop
```

### 6. Cleaning Up (Optional)
Delete feature branches after successful merge:

```bash
git branch -d feature/xyz      # Delete local branch
git push origin -d feature/xyz # Delete remote branch
```

## Best Practices

1. **Never Develop Directly on Develop Branch**: Always create a feature branch.
2. **Complete the Cycle**: Always finish one feature by merging it back to develop before starting the next.
3. **Merge Completed Features Promptly**: Don't let feature branches live too long.
4. **Update Feature Branches Regularly**: Merge develop into feature branches often.
5. **Use Descriptive Branch Names**: Name branches in the format `feature/descriptive-name`.
6. **Write Clear Commit Messages**: Use conventional commit format (e.g., "feat:", "fix:", "docs:").
7. **Create Single-Purpose Branches**: Each branch should represent one logical feature or fix.
8. **Test Before Merging**: Always verify functionality before merging to develop.

## Common Git Commands Reference

| Purpose | Command | Explanation |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| View status | `git status` | Shows changed files |
| Switch branches | `git checkout branch-name` | Moves to another branch |
| Create new branch | `git checkout -b branch-name` | Creates and switches to new branch |
| Get latest changes | `git pull` | Updates current branch from remote |
| Stage changes | `git add .` | Stages all changes |
| Commit changes | `git commit -m "message"` | Commits staged changes |
| Merge branches | `git merge branch-name` | Brings changes from branch-name into current branch |
| Publish changes | `git push` | Sends commits to remote repository |
| View branch graph | `git log --graph --oneline --all` | Shows branch structure graphically |
| View differences | `git diff` | Shows uncommitted changes |

## Handling Merge Conflicts

When you encounter merge conflicts:

1. **Understand the conflict**: Look for conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
2. **Edit the files**: Manually resolve each conflict
3. **Stage the resolutions**: `git add [resolved files]`
4. **Complete the merge**: `git commit` (Git will provide a default merge commit message)

Remember, regular communication with team members about active feature branches helps avoid conflicts and integration problems.

## Report Formats
### Excel Reports
- Depth analysis including problem sections
- Position analysis with quality metrics
- Combined analysis with comprehensive data

### PDF Reports
- Project details and metadata
- Issue summaries and recommendations
- Links to interactive visualizations

## Troubleshooting Guide
### Common Issues and Solutions
1. **DataFrame Validation Error**  
   - **Issue**: DataFrame operations failing due to `None` values.
   - **Solution**: Use explicit checks: `if isinstance(dataframe, pd.DataFrame) and not dataframe.empty:`

2. **PDF Report Not Generating**  
   - **Issue**: ReportLab not formatting output correctly.
   - **Solution**: Ensure ReportLab dependencies are installed and correctly configured.

3. **Analyzer Not Recognizing Data**  
   - **Issue**: Analyzer does not process input files.
   - **Solution**: Check if correct analyzer type is instantiated (`DepthAnalyzer`, `PositionAnalyzer`).

## Next Steps
1. 🔴 Begin incremental refactoring of `app.py` (Critical priority)
   - Start with worker thread extraction
   - Implement modular design following SRP
2. 🔴 Implement comprehensive testing framework (Critical priority)
3. 🔴 Harmonize analyzer classes - method signatures and terminology (High priority)
4. 🔴 Complete refactoring of report generator for improved modularity (High priority)
5. 🟠 Enhance file operations security (Medium priority)
6. 🟠 Optimize performance for large datasets (Medium priority)
7. 🟡 Expand documentation and user examples (Low priority)
8. ⚪ Implement factory pattern for analyzer selection (Future enhancement)
