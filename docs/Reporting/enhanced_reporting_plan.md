# CBATool Enhanced Reporting and Analysis Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
The Cable Burial Analysis Tool (CBATool) is undergoing a significant enhancement to improve reporting, configuration, and analysis capabilities.

## Key Objectives
1. Comprehensive Reporting System Upgrade
2. Flexible Cable Identifier Management
3. Variable Depth of Burial Support
4. Enhanced Route Comparison Capabilities
5. Improved Logging and Traceability

## Architectural Principles
- Follow SOLID principles
- Maintain DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) approach
- Ensure Enterprise-grade code quality
- Prioritize extensibility and maintainability

## Milestone 1: Configuration and Identifier Management

### Configuration Enhancements
- Extend existing configuration management in `app.py`
- Add support for:
  * Project-specific cable identifiers
  * Branding logo configuration
  * Flexible analysis settings

#### Configuration Storage
- Continue using JSON-based configuration
- Add new fields:
  ```json
  {
    "projectName": "Project Name",
    "cableIdentifiers": [
      {
        "type": "EXC",
        "identifiers": ["GLex1", "GLex2"]
      },
      {
        "type": "IAC",
        "identifiers": ["GLine1", "GLine2"]
      }
    ],
    "branding": {
      "clientLogo": "/path/to/client/logo.png",
      "subcontractorLogo": "/path/to/subcontractor/logo.png"
    }
  }
  ```

### Cable Identifier Management
- Implement dropdown selection in UI
- Validation mechanisms:
  * Prevent analysis without identifier
  * Load identifiers from project configuration
  * Support dynamic identifier addition

## Milestone 2: Variable Depth of Burial Analysis

### CSV Input Specification
- Standard CSV format:
  ```
  KP,rmDOL,TDOL
  0.0,1.5,2.0
  1.0,1.7,2.2
  ```

### Depth Compliance Calculation
- Interpolation Strategy:
  * Explicit user confirmation required
  * Options for interpolation:
    1. No interpolation
    2. Linear interpolation
    3. Custom interpolation method
- Compliance Calculation:
  * Compare actual depth against variable target depth
  * Highlight sections with non-compliance
  * Generate detailed recommendations

### Interpolation Handling
- Develop a robust interpolation module
- User dialog for gap handling:
  * Small gaps (<10m): Suggest interpolation
  * Medium gaps (10-50m): Warn and request manual review
  * Large gaps (>50m): Block analysis, require manual input

## Milestone 3: Route Comparison Capabilities

### Comparison Options
1. Planned Route (RPL)
2. As-Laid Route
3. Hybrid Comparison

### Deviation Metrics
- Cumulative deviation
- Significant deviation points
- Statistical summary
- Visualization of route variations

## Milestone 4: Enhanced Logging and Traceability

### Logging Requirements
- Capture all analysis parameters
- Record:
  * Input data characteristics
  * Calculation steps
  * Compliance determinations
  * Recommendations generated
- Implement multi-level logging:
  * DEBUG
  * INFO
  * WARNING
  * ERROR

### Log Storage
- JSON-based log format
- Timestamp all log entries
- Include unique analysis identifier
- Store logs with corresponding analysis output

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each component
- Integration testing
- User acceptance testing
- Performance benchmarking

## Potential Challenges
- Handling varying CSV input formats
- Managing complex interpolation scenarios
- Ensuring performance with large datasets

## Future Considerations
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Advanced route optimization recommendations
- Cloud-based analysis and comparison

## Versioning and Compatibility
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Provide migration paths for existing configurations
- Clear documentation of changes

## Open Questions
1. Specific interpolation preference for small data gaps
2. Detailed branding requirements
3. Performance expectations for large route datasets

## Development Workflow
- Use feature branches
- Conduct thorough code reviews
- Maintain comprehensive documentation
- Follow conventional commit guidelines
