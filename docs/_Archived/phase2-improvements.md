# CBAtool v2.0 Phase 2 Implementation Plan

## Performance Optimization Roadmap

This document outlines the planned improvements for Phase 2 of CBAtool development, focusing on performance optimization and version control implementation via GitHub.

### 1. Memory Management Improvements

#### Data Chunking for Large Files
- Implement a chunked loading mechanism in `DataLoader` class
- Process data in segments rather than loading entire files into memory
- Add a `chunk_size` parameter to control memory usage

```python
def load_data_in_chunks(self, chunk_size=10000):
    """Load and process data in manageable chunks."""
    for chunk in pd.read_csv(self.file_path, chunksize=chunk_size):
        # Process each chunk
        yield chunk
```

#### Reduce DataFrame Copies
- Audit code for unnecessary DataFrame copies
- Replace `.copy()` operations with views where possible
- Use in-place operations with the `inplace=True` parameter

```python
# Before
df2 = df1.copy()
df2['new_column'] = df2['old_column'] * 2

# After
df1['new_column'] = df1['old_column'] * 2
```

#### Memory Profiling
- Add memory usage tracking
- Implement memory threshold warnings
- Create a memory-efficient mode for very large datasets

### 2. Algorithm Optimization

#### Vectorize Row-by-Row Operations
- Replace `apply()` and loop-based operations with vectorized NumPy operations
- Use built-in pandas methods like `df.sum()`, `df.mean()` instead of iterating
- Implement batch processing for unavoidable loops

```python
# Before
result = df.apply(lambda row: complex_function(row), axis=1)

# After
result = complex_function_vectorized(df)
```

#### Efficient Pandas Methods
- Replace `iterrows()` with vectorized operations
- Use `pd.cut()` for binning operations
- Leverage `groupby()` with built-in aggregation functions

#### Caching for Repeated Calculations
- Implement memoization for expensive calculations
- Cache intermediate results that are reused
- Store preprocessing results to avoid recalculation

### 3. Parallel Processing

#### Multiprocessing for Analysis
- Parallelize data processing for CPU-intensive tasks
- Implement worker pools for batch processing
- Add progress tracking for parallel operations

```python
def analyze_in_parallel(self, data, num_workers=4):
    """Analyze data using multiple processes."""
    with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=num_workers) as executor:
        futures = [executor.submit(self._analyze_chunk, chunk) for chunk in np.array_split(data, num_workers)]
        results = [f.result() for f in futures]
    return pd.concat(results)
```

#### Background Processing for UI
- Move long-running tasks to background threads
- Implement a job queue system
- Add cancellation capability for running jobs

### 4. GitHub Version Control Implementation

#### Repository Setup
1. Initialize repository
   ```bash
   git init
   ```
2. Create .gitignore file for Python
   ```
   __pycache__/
   *.py[cod]
   *$py.class
   *.so
   .env
   .venv
   env/
   venv/
   *.log
   .DS_Store
   ```
3. Add and commit initial codebase
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit of CBAtool v2.0"
   ```

#### Branching Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for new features
- `feature/*`: Individual feature branches
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fix branches
- `release/*`: Preparation for new releases

#### Workflow
1. Create feature branch for each improvement
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/memory-optimization
   ```
2. Make changes and commit regularly
   ```bash
   git add modified_files
   git commit -m "Implemented chunked data loading"
   ```
3. Push branch to remote
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/memory-optimization
   ```
4. Create Pull Request for review
5. Merge to develop after approval
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git merge feature/memory-optimization
   git push origin develop
   ```

#### Testing & Integration
- Set up automated testing for each PR
- Implement CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
- Require code review before merging

## Implementation Timeline

| Week | Priority Tasks | Secondary Tasks |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| 1    | Set up GitHub repository<br>Memory profiling | Create branching strategy documentation |
| 2    | Implement data chunking<br>Reduce DataFrame copies | Set up GitHub Actions for basic testing |
| 3    | Vectorize core algorithms<br>Implement caching | Create performance benchmark tests |
| 4    | Implement parallel processing<br>Background UI processing | Finalize CI/CD pipeline |

## Performance Metrics

To track improvements, we'll measure:
- Memory usage for standard dataset sizes
- Processing time for key operations
- UI responsiveness under load
- Load time for large files

Each optimization will be benchmarked against the current version to quantify improvements.

## Next Steps

After completing Phase 2, we'll move to Phase 3 (UI Enhancements), which will build on the performance improvements to create a more responsive and full-featured user interface.
