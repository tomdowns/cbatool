# Position Analysis Enhancement Requirements

## 1. Data Source Details
- [ ] Primary coordinate types available:
  - [X] GPS Latitude/Longitude
  - [X] Easting/Northing
  - [X] Kilometer Points (KP)
  - [ ] Other: ________________
- [ ] Typical coordinate system used: Easting/Northing and WGS84________________
- [ ] Source of position data (e.g., survey equipment, GPS): USBL, Inertial Navigation, GPS________________

## 2. Current Infrastructure Assessment
- [ ] Existing `PositionAnalyzer` capabilities:
  - [ ] KP continuity checking
  - [ ] Cross-track deviation analysis
  - [ ] Coordinate validation
- [ ] Specific methods that need enhancement: On your recommendations________________
- [ ] Anticipated complexity of proposed changes (Low/Medium/High): Low to Medium________________

## 3. Performance Considerations
- [ ] Typical dataset size:
  - [ ] Number of data points per file: 20000 - 80000________________
  - [ ] Average file size (MB): 20 - 40 mb________________
- [ ] Maximum expected dataset size: 150mb________________
- [ ] Performance constraints:
  - [ ] Maximum processing time: Minimised________________
  - [ ] Memory usage limits: As efficient as possible________________

## 4. Route Deviation Thresholds
- [ ] Significant deviation definition:
  - [ ] Lateral distance threshold (meters): To be added to User defined section. DEFAULT = 5m ________________
  - [ ] Percentage deviation from planned route: Not a client defined limit, but good to present ________________
- [ ] Cumulative deviation tolerance: Not understood, additional insight required________________
- [ ] Severity levels for deviations:
  - [ ] Low deviation range: Help needed for definition, statistical or fixed?________________
  - [ ] Medium deviation range: Help needed for definition, statistical or fixed?________________
  - [ ] High deviation range: Help needed for definition, statistical or fixed?________________

## 5. Data Gap Handling
- [ ] Preferred gap handling methods:
  - [ ] [X] Interpolation
  - [ ] [X] Flagging
  - [ ] [ ] Removal
  - [ ] [ ] Partial preservation
- [ ] Maximum acceptable gap size: User defined________________
- [ ] Interpolation method preference:
  - [ ] Linear
  - [ ] Cubic
  - [ ] Spline
  - [ ] Other: Options for best application________________

## 6. Visualization Requirements
- [ ] Required visualization types:
  - [ ] [X] Heat maps
  - [ ] [X] Line graphs
  - [ ] [X] Geographical overlays
  - [ ] [X] Statistical charts
- [ ] Specific color coding needed: Allow user choice from standard color maps________________
- [ ] Interactivity requirements: ________________

## 7. Error Handling and Validation
- [ ] Critical validation checks:
  - [ ] [X] Coordinate system consistency
  - [ ] [X] Data range validity
  - [ ] [X] Sensor reliability assessment
- [ ] Logging requirements for validation failures: High quality, easy to assess and access logging________________
- [ ] Handling of invalid data points: flag points________________

## 8. Configurability
- [ ] User-configurable parameters:
  - [ ] [X] Deviation thresholds
  - [ ] [X] Gap handling method
  - [ ] [X] Visualization settings
- [ ] Configuration storage method:
  - [X] JSON
  - [ ] YAML
  - [ ] Other: ________________
- [ ] Default configuration details: Create default config files that are well justified and backed by common practice________________

## 9. Integration Points
- [ ] Integration with existing components:
  - [ ] [X] Depth analysis
  - [ ] [X] Visualization system
  - [ ] [X] Reporting module
- [ ] Cross-referencing requirements: All data is related, it should be reported as such________________
- [ ] Shared data model considerations: Explain in greater detail________________

## 10. Output and Reporting
- [ ] Required output types:
  - [ ] [X] Numerical reports
  - [ ] [X] Visual reports
  - [ ] [X] Detailed logs
  - [ ] [X] Summary statistics
- [ ] Report format preferences:
  - [X] Excel
  - [ ] CSV
  - [X] PDF
  - [X] HTML
- [ ] Specific metrics to include in reports: Percentage achieved at target burial, Gap highlighting, Problem zone highlighting, Sensible statistical analysis________________

## Additional Notes
- Any other specific requirements or constraints:
  Easy to distribute summary information________________________________________________
  Simple digestable graphics________________________________________________
