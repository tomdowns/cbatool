## Project Overview

The CBAtool (Cable Burial Analysis Tool) is a Python application for analyzing cable burial depth data and position quality. It enables users to identify non-compliant sections, detect anomalies, and generate interactive visualizations and reports.
CBAtool has made substantial progress in its architectural foundation, but a comprehensive code review has identified several critical issues that need to be addressed before production deployment. The most urgent priorities are implementing a testing framework, harmonizing analyzer classes, restructuring the UI application, and refactoring the report generator for improved maintainability and reliability.

## Development Principles

- **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- **YAGNI** (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- **SOLID principles** (for maintainable and scalable code)
- **AIM for enteprise grade code**

## Current Development Status

- Links to interactive visualizations

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **DataFrame Validation Error**  
   - **Issue**: DataFrame operations failing due to `None` values.
   - **Solution**: Use explicit checks: `if isinstance(dataframe, pd.DataFrame) and not dataframe.empty:`

2. **PDF Report Not Generating**  
   - **Issue**: ReportLab not formatting output correctly.
   - **Solution**: Ensure ReportLab dependencies are installed and correctly configured.

3. **Analyzer Not Recognizing Data**  
   - **Issue**: Analyzer does not process input files.
   - **Solution**: Check if correct analyzer type is instantiated (`DepthAnalyzer`, `PositionAnalyzer`).

## Project Status Summary

CBAtool has evolved significantly since inception, with substantial improvements across multiple domains:

- **Architectural Advances**: Successfully implemented BaseAnalyzer abstract class with specialized analyzer subclasses (DepthAnalyzer, PositionAnalyzer) that follow SOLID principles.
- **Reporting Capabilities**: Developed a comprehensive ReportGenerator class for PDF and Excel outputs, though some formatting issues remain.
- **UI Enhancements**: Added coordinate column support (Lat/Long and Easting/Northing) with auto-detection.
- **Code Quality**: Completed extensive code review identifying priority areas for improvement.
- **Documentation**: Consolidated and updated all key documentation files.
