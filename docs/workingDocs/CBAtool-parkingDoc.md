## Project Overview

The CBAtool (Cable Burial Analysis Tool) is a Python application for analyzing cable burial depth data and position quality. It enables users to identify non-compliant sections, detect anomalies, and generate interactive visualizations and reports.
CBAtool has made substantial progress in its architectural foundation, but a comprehensive code review has identified several critical issues that need to be addressed before production deployment. The most urgent priorities are implementing a testing framework, harmonizing analyzer classes, restructuring the UI application, and refactoring the report generator for improved maintainability and reliability.

## Development Principles

- **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- **YAGNI** (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
