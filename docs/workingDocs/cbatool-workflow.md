## Overview

This document establishes a structured approach for implementing incremental improvements to the CBATool codebase. The focus is on making small, manageable changes while maintaining code quality and stability throughout the development process.

**Key Principles:**

1. **Incremental Progress**: Favor small, focused changes over large refactoring efforts
2. **Consistency**: Follow established patterns and coding standards
3. **Documentation**: Keep track of changes, decisions, and rationales
4. **Quality**: Maintain or improve code quality with each change
5. **Collaboration**: Enable effective teamwork through clear communication

## Workflow Process

The iterative improvement process follows these stages:

1. **Identification**
   - Identify specific issues or improvement opportunities
   - Document the current implementation and issues
   - Link to design principles being violated (if applicable)

2. **Planning**
   - Classify the change (size, impact, priority)
   - Define the scope and acceptance criteria
   - Break down large changes into smaller, manageable tasks
   - Create tracking issues with detailed descriptions

3. **Implementation**
   - Create feature branch from main/develop
   - Make changes incrementally with atomic commits
   - Update documentation as needed
   - Run tests to verify changes

4. **Review**
   - Submit pull request with detailed description
   - Conduct code review (1-2 reviewers depending on complexity)
   - Address feedback and make necessary adjustments
   - Update tracking documentation

5. **Integration**
   - Merge changes into target branch
   - Update changelog
   - Close associated issues and link to changes
   - Plan follow-up improvements if needed

6. **Reflection**
   - Document lessons learned
   - Identify any follow-up improvements
   - Update workflow process if needed

# Git Workflow Guide

## Branch Structure
The CBATool project uses a three-tier branching strategy:

```
main (stable, production-ready code)
  ↑
develop (integration branch)
  ↑
feature branches (one per feature)
```

## Workflow Process

### 1. Starting Feature Development
Always start by creating a feature branch from the latest develop branch:

```bash
git checkout develop         # Start from develop branch
git pull                     # Make sure it's up to date
git checkout -b feature/xyz  # Create new feature branch
```

### 2. Making Regular Commits
Make small, focused commits with descriptive messages:

```bash
git add [changed files]
git commit -m "feat: descriptive message about changes"
```

### 3. Staying Updated with Develop
Regularly integrate changes from develop to avoid divergence:

```bash
git checkout develop
git pull
git checkout feature/xyz
git merge develop           # Merge develop into your feature branch
# Resolve any conflicts
```

### 4. Completing Feature Development
Before merging, ensure your feature is complete and tested:

```bash
# Run tests to make sure everything works
git push -u origin feature/xyz  # Push to remote repository
```

### 5. Merging Feature into Develop
Use the no-fast-forward flag to preserve feature branch history:

```bash
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff feature/xyz   # --no-ff preserves feature branch history
git push origin develop
```

### 6. Cleaning Up (Optional)
Delete feature branches after successful merge:

```bash
git branch -d feature/xyz      # Delete local branch
git push origin -d feature/xyz # Delete remote branch
```

## Best Practices

1. **Never Develop Directly on Develop Branch**: Always create a feature branch.
2. **Complete the Cycle**: Always finish one feature by merging it back to develop before starting the next.
3. **Merge Completed Features Promptly**: Don't let feature branches live too long.
4. **Update Feature Branches Regularly**: Merge develop into feature branches often.
5. **Use Descriptive Branch Names**: Name branches in the format `feature/descriptive-name`.
6. **Write Clear Commit Messages**: Use conventional commit format (e.g., "feat:", "fix:", "docs:").
7. **Create Single-Purpose Branches**: Each branch should represent one logical feature or fix.
8. **Test Before Merging**: Always verify functionality before merging to develop.

## Common Git Commands Reference

| Purpose | Command | Explanation |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| View status | `git status` | Shows changed files |
| Switch branches | `git checkout branch-name` | Moves to another branch |
| Create new branch | `git checkout -b branch-name` | Creates and switches to new branch |
| Get latest changes | `git pull` | Updates current branch from remote |
| Stage changes | `git add .` | Stages all changes |
| Commit changes | `git commit -m "message"` | Commits staged changes |
| Merge branches | `git merge branch-name` | Brings changes from branch-name into current branch |
| Publish changes | `git push` | Sends commits to remote repository |
| View branch graph | `git log --graph --oneline --all` | Shows branch structure graphically |
| View differences | `git diff` | Shows uncommitted changes |

## Handling Merge Conflicts

When you encounter merge conflicts:

1. **Understand the conflict**: Look for conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
2. **Edit the files**: Manually resolve each conflict
3. **Stage the resolutions**: `git add [resolved files]`
4. **Complete the merge**: `git commit` (Git will provide a default merge commit message)

Remember, regular communication with team members about active feature branches helps avoid conflicts and integration problems.

## Improvement Classification

## Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

For significant architectural decisions like the BaseAnalyzer refactoring, maintain ADRs to document:

1. **Context**: The situation that called for a decision
2. **Decision**: The architectural change that was made
3. **Status**: Current state (proposed, accepted, implemented, deprecated)
4. **Consequences**: Positive and negative implications of the decision
5. **Alternatives**: Options that were considered but not chosen

ADRs should be stored in the `docs/architecture/decisions` directory with the naming format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.

### ADR Template

```markdown
# [Title of Architectural Decision]

## Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Implemented | Deprecated]

## Context
[Description of the forces at play and the problem that motivated this decision]

## Decision
[Description of the architectural change that addresses the problem]

## Consequences
### Positive
- [Positive consequence 1]
- [Positive consequence 2]

### Negative
- [Negative consequence 1]
- [Negative consequence 2]

## Alternatives Considered
- [Alternative 1]
- [Alternative 2]

Improvements are classified based on size, impact, and priority to help with planning and resource allocation:

### Size Classification

| Size | Description | Lines Changed | Scope |
|------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Small | Self-contained changes | <100 lines | Single file or component |
| Medium | Limited-scope changes | 100-300 lines | Multiple related files |
| Large | Significant changes | >300 lines | Multiple components |

### Impact Classification

| Impact | Description | Risk Level | Review Requirements |
|--------|-------------|------------|---------------------|
| Low | Internal changes with minimal external effects | Low | 1 reviewer |
| Medium | Changes affecting multiple components | Moderate | 1-2 reviewers |
| High | Core functionality or architecture changes | High | 2+ reviewers + design review |

### Priority Classification

| Priority | Description | Timeline | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|----------|
| Critical | Blockers, major bugs | Immediate | Data corruption, crashes |
| High | Important functionality | Current sprint | Core feature improvements |
| Medium | Significant improvements | Next 2-3 sprints | Code quality enhancements |
| Low | Nice-to-have enhancements | When available | Minor optimizations |

## Git Workflow

The project follows a feature branch workflow:

### Branch Structure

- `main`: Production-ready code, always stable
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- Feature branches: Named `feature/issue-number-description`
- Bugfix branches: Named `bugfix/issue-number-description`

### Commit Guidelines

Each commit should:

1. Address a single logical change
2. Include a descriptive commit message
3. Reference the issue number 
4. Pass all tests and quality checks

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>

<detailed description>

Refs #<issue-number>
```

Where:
- **type**: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- **scope**: analyzer, visualizer, ui, etc.
- **short summary**: concise description in present tense
- **detailed description**: explains the what and why
- **issue-number**: reference to the associated issue

Example:
```
refactor(analyzer): extract BaseAnalyzer class

Extract common analyzer functionality into an abstract base class
to improve code organization and enable specialized analyzers.

Refs #42
```

### Branch Lifecycle

```
# Create a feature branch
git checkout develop
git pull
git checkout -b feature/42-refactor-analyzer

# Make changes with descriptive commits
git add path/to/changed/files
git commit -m "refactor(analyzer): extract BaseAnalyzer class"

# Keep branch updated with develop
git fetch
git rebase origin/develop

# Submit pull request (through GitHub/GitLab UI)
# After approval...

# Merge to develop (squash if many small commits)
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff feature/42-refactor-analyzer
git push origin develop
```

## Issue Tracking

Each improvement should be tracked as an issue in the project's issue tracker (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).

### Issue Structure

- **Title**: Clear, concise description of the improvement
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of the issue/improvement
- **Labels**: Type (bug, enhancement, refactor), priority, size
- **Assignee**: Person responsible for implementation
- **Milestone**: Target release or sprint
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, measurable outcomes

### Issue States

1. **Backlog**: Identified but not yet scheduled
2. **Todo**: Scheduled for current sprint
3. **In Progress**: Actively being worked on
4. **Review**: Changes submitted for review
5. **Done**: Fully implemented and merged

## Change Logging

### Example Workflow

Here's an example of how to use this workflow for a specific improvement:

1. **Identify Issue**: The `Analyzer` class violates SRP by handling multiple responsibilities.

2. **Create Issue**:
   ```
   Title: Refactor Analyzer class to follow Single Responsibility Principle
   
   Description: The Analyzer class currently handles data loading, anomaly detection,
   compliance checking, and section identification. This violates SRP and makes
   the class difficult to maintain and extend.
   
   Proposed Solution: Create a BaseAnalyzer abstract class and specialized
   analyzer classes (DepthAnalyzer, PositionAnalyzer) to better separate concerns.
   
   Labels: refactoring, medium-size
   ```

3. **Create Improvement Tracker**: Create `improvements/42-refactor-analyzer.md` using the template.

4. **Implement Changes**:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull
   git checkout -b feature/42-refactor-analyzer
   
   # Make changes...
   
   git add core/base_analyzer.py
   git commit -m "feat(analyzer): create abstract BaseAnalyzer class"
   
   git add core/depth_analyzer.py
   git commit -m "feat(analyzer): implement DepthAnalyzer class"
   
   git add core/position_analyzer.py
   git commit -m "feat(analyzer): implement PositionAnalyzer class"
   
   git add core/analyzer.py
   git commit -m "refactor(analyzer): update main Analyzer to use new classes"
   ```

5. **Update Tracker**: Add progress to the improvement tracker document.

6. **Create Pull Request**: Submit PR with detailed description using the template.

7. **Code Review**: Address feedback and update as needed.

8. **Merge Changes**:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git merge --no-ff feature/42-refactor-analyzer
   git push origin develop
   ```

9. **Update Changelog**: Add entry to CHANGELOG.md.

10. **Close Issue**: Close issue #42 with reference to the PR.

11. **Sprint Summary**: Include this improvement in the sprint summary.

## Implementation Success Cases

### BaseAnalyzer Refactoring Implementation

The refactoring of the analyzer components into a class hierarchy with `BaseAnalyzer` as the abstract parent class has been successfully completed. This implementation:

- Created a proper abstraction for common analyzer functionality
- Established specialized analyzers (DepthAnalyzer, PositionAnalyzer) with focused responsibilities
- Standardized interfaces and error handling across analyzer types
- Improved maintainability and extensibility for future analyzer types

This refactoring serves as an excellent template for future architectural improvements and demonstrates effective application of the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

Key metrics:
- Lines of code changed: ~750
- Files affected: 3 new files created, 1 file deprecated
- Test coverage: 92%
- Development time: 2 weeks

### Best Practices

1. **Keep Changes Small**: Smaller changes are easier to review, test, and merge.

2. **Commit Frequently**: Make atomic commits that represent logical units of work.

3. **Document Decisions**: Record the "why" behind significant changes, not just the "what".

4. **Maintain Test Coverage**: Add or update tests for all changes.

5. **Continuous Feedback**: Seek early feedback on design and implementation.

6. **Code Reviews**: Treat code reviews as collaborative learning opportunities.

7. **Incremental Refactoring**: Improve code quality incrementally rather than in large rewrites.

8. **Regular Integration**: Frequently integrate changes to avoid diverging too far from the main codebase.

9. **Continuous Learning**: Regularly review and adapt the workflow based on experience.

10. **Communication**: Keep the team informed about significant changes and decisions.

11. **Template Existing Solutions**: Use successful implementations like the BaseAnalyzer as templates for similar refactoring efforts.

12. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure new architectures maintain compatibility with existing code to allow for gradual adoption.

13. **Interface First Development**: Define interfaces before implementation details to ensure cohesive component interaction.
